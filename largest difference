To find the largest difference between two elements in an array such that the smaller element comes before the larger element, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize variables to keep track of the minimum element encountered and the maximum difference found.
2. Iterate through the array.
3. For each element, calculate the difference between the current element and the minimum element encountered so far.
4. If the calculated difference is greater than the maximum difference found, update the maximum difference.
5. Update the minimum element if the current element is smaller than the minimum element.
6. Continue iterating through the array.
7. Return the maximum difference found.

Here's a Python function that implements this algorithm:

```python
def max_difference(arr):
    if len(arr) < 2:
        return None  # Not enough elements to find a difference

    min_element = arr[0]
    max_diff = arr[1] - arr[0]

    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        current_diff = arr[i] - min_element
        max_diff = max(max_diff, current_diff)
        min_element = min(min_element, arr[i])

    return max_diff

# Example usage
arr = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
result = max_difference(arr)
print("Largest difference:", result)  # Output should be 5 (6 - 1)
```

Replace the `arr` list with your own list of integers to find the largest difference in your specific case.
