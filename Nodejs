Write the output of the program as mentioned below. const add = 10+2 console.log(add) //output as: The added value is () const subs = 10-2 console.log(subs) //output as: The substracted value is ()

```javascript
const add = 10 + 2;
console.log(`The added value is ${add}`);

const subs = 10 - 2;
console.log(`The subtracted value is ${subs}`);
```

When you run this Node.js program, you'll get the desired output:

```
The added value is 12
The subtracted value is 8
```
