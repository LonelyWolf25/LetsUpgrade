You can create a Python program to calculate the area of a square based on the side length by defining an `area()` function as follows:

```python
def area(side_length):
    return side_length ** 2

# Taking user input for the side length of the square
side_length = float(input("Enter the side length of the square: "))

# Calculate the area using the area() function
square_area = area(side_length)

# Print the calculated area
print("The area of the square with side length", side_length, "is:", square_area)
```

This program defines an `area()` function that takes the side length as input and calculates the area of the square. It then takes user input for the side length, calls the `area()` function to calculate the area, and prints the result.
