You can create a Python program to perform these operations as follows:

```python
# Taking user inputs for variables a and b
a = float(input("Enter the value of 'a': "))
b = float(input("Enter the value of 'b': "))

# Floor Division
floor_division_result = a // b
print("Floor Division Result:", floor_division_result)

# Power of a to b
power_result = a ** b
print("a to the power of b:", power_result)

# Check if a and b have equal values
equal_values = (a == b)
print("Do 'a' and 'b' have equal values?", equal_values)
```

This program will take two inputs 'a' and 'b', perform the floor division, calculate 'a' to the power of 'b', and check if 'a' and 'b' have equal values.
