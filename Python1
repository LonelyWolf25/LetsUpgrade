/* Write a Python program to classify a given number into one of three categories: negative, zero, or positive. The program should take an integer input and print out one of the following statements based on the input:

"The number is negative." if the number is less than zero.
"The number is zero." if the number is exactly zero.
"The number is positive." if the number is more than zero.
*/

```python
def classify_number(num):
    if num < 0:
        print("The number is negative.")
    elif num == 0:
        print("The number is zero.")
    else:
        print("The number is positive.")

# Take user input as an integer
user_input = input("Enter an integer: ")

# Validate if the input is a valid integer
try:
    user_number = int(user_input)
    classify_number(user_number)
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.")
```

This program defines a function `classify_number` that takes an integer as input and prints out the corresponding classification 
based on the rules you provided. The program then takes user input, converts it to an integer (handling potential ValueError if the input is not a valid integer), 
and calls the `classify_number` function with the user's input./
